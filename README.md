# ImproveLateTrain
Rakevet 1.3

The goal of this app is to create pressure on the Israeli Railway, in order that our trains will stop being late!

How?
In this app you can report when the train is late and by how much time, so you can see the total waiting amount.

Features:
1. You can see how much money the time that we have waited worth*.
2. You can complain in a chat room with everyone who has the app, in order for us to have more proof, and create more pressure.
3. You can upload images, in order for us to have more proof, and create more pressure.
4. You can see how much time the train was late in a calendar (per day).


*we estimate that value by the average sallery by the average working hours per month.
